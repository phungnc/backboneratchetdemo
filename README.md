<h3 class="component-title">Simple Backbone Wedding Checklist!</h3>
<p>Recently, I find out <a href="http://maker.github.com/ratchet/">Ratchet</a>, the prototye iPhone apps with simple HTML, CSS and JS components</p>		
<p>I really love the simple, so I try create a simple demo like iPhone App with Backbone.js and Ratchet.css</p>	
<p>The Backbone.js side is similar to common Backbone Todo Example, except the modal Add, Edit View</p>	
<p>By using two of Backbone.js and Ratchet.css, I think iPhone App UI is built so fast</p>	
<p>In this demo, I use only Ratchet.css and I also borrow their page's style and their iPhone :)</p>
